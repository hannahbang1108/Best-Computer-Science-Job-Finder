# Best-Computer-Science-Job-Finder

This project analyzes recent Computer Science (CS) job salary data to figure out the best CS jobs to pursue. 

## Description
This project is a data analysis walkthrough presented as a Jupyter Notebook analyzing recent CS job salary data (2025) to figure out the best CS jobs to pursue, created as a cumulative open-ended project for the 'Intermediate Programming with Data' course offered at Northeastern. I utilize various Python libraries and Data Science techniques to analyze the 'AI, ML, Data Science Salary (2020- 2025)' dataset from Kaggle, which contains salary and Employment trends in AI, ML, and Data Science from the past 5 years. In context, I define success based on: 1) Popularity: how common the job is, 2) Salary, how much the job pays. At the end of the notebook, I summarize include a summary of my results.
  
## Technologies Used
* Python: The core language for the backend, handling data processing and business logic.
* pandas: A data analysis and manipulation library, likely used for handling job listing data.
* collections: Keeps count of values.
* math: Provides basic mathematical functions.
* numpy: Creates weighted vectors and sums for calculations.
* matplotlib: Creates visual graph representations.
* sklearn: Provides linear regression and K-means clustering algorithms.
* seaborn: Produces visually appealing scatter plots.
